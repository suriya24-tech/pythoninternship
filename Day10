1)Write a Python program for all the cases which can check a string contains only a certain set of characters (in this case a-z, A-Z and 0-9):

import re
def is_allowed_specific_char(string):
    charRe = re.compile(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9.]')
    string = charRe.search(string)
    return not bool(string)

print(is_allowed_specific_char("QWERTYasdfgh09876")) 
print(is_allowed_specific_char("~!@#$%^"))

Output:
True
False

2)Write a Python program that matches a word containing 'ab':

import re
def tex(c):
        s = '\w*ab.\w*'
        if re.search(s,  c):
                return 'Found a match!'
        else:
                return('Not matched!')

print(tex("The b;ood group of my friend is ab+"))
print(tex("Internship tasks"))

Output:

Found a match!
Not matched!

3)Write a Python program to check for a number at the end of a word/sentence:

import re 

a = "This is my 10 days internship task"
print ("The original string is : " + a) 
b = len(re.findall(r'\w+', a)) 
print ("The number of words in string are : " + str(b))

Output:
The original string is : This is my 10 days internship task
The number of words in string are : 7

4)Write a Python program to search the numbers (0-9) of length between 1 to 3 in a given string:

import re
results = re.finditer(r"([0-9]{1,3})", "There are many people in our life but 3 people would be very much needs 1.mom 2.dad 3.siblings")
print("Number of length 1 to 3")
for n in results:
     print(n.group(0))
     
Output:
Number of length 1 to 3
3
1
2
3

5)Write a Python program to match a string that contains only uppercase letters

import re
def a(b):
        x = '[A-Z]*$'
        if re.search(x,  b):
                return 'Found a match!'
        else:
                return('Not matched!')

print(a("This is my PYTHON internship task day 10"))
Found a match!
